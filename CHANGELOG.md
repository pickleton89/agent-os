- **Instruction Clarity** - Simplified create-spec workflow with cleaner delegation pattern
- **Error Handling** - More robust date determination with dedicated validation rules

## [1.3.0] - 2025-08-01

### Added
- **Pre-flight Check System** - New `meta/pre-flight.md` instruction for centralized agent detection and initialization
- **Proactive Agent Usage** - Updated agent descriptions to encourage proactive use when appropriate
- **Structured Instruction Organization** - New folder structure with `core/` and `meta/` subdirectories

### Changed
- **Instruction File Structure** - Reorganized all instruction files into subdirectories:
  - Core instructions moved to `instructions/core/` (plan-product, create-spec, execute-tasks, execute-task, analyze-product)
  - Meta instructions in `instructions/meta/` (pre-flight, more to come)
- **Simplified XML Metadata** - Removed verbose `<ai_meta>` and `<step_metadata>` blocks for cleaner, more readable instructions
- **Subagent Integration** - Replaced manual agent detection with centralized pre-flight check across all instruction files to enforce delegation and preserve main agent's context.

- **Agent Efficiency** - Centralized agent detection reduces repeated checks throughout workflows
- **Maintainability** - Cleaner instruction format with less XML boilerplate
- **User Experience** - Clearer indication of when specialized agents will be used proactively

### Removed

## [1.2.0] - 2025-07-29

### Added
- **Claude Code Specialized Subagents** - New agents to offload specific tasks for improved efficiency:
  - `test-runner.md` - Handles test execution and failure analysis with minimal toolset
  - `context-fetcher.md` - Retrieves information from files while checking context to avoid duplication
  - `git-workflow.md` - Manages git operations, branches, commits, and PR creation
  - `file-creator.md` - Creates files, directories, and applies consistent templates
- **Agent Detection Pattern** - Single check at process start with boolean flags for efficiency
- **Subagent Integration** across all instruction files with automatic fallback for non-Claude Code users

### Changed
- **Instruction Files** - All updated to support conditional agent usage:
  - `execute-tasks.md` - Uses git-workflow (branch management, PR creation), test-runner (full suite), and context-fetcher (loading lite files)
  - `execute-task.md` - Uses context-fetcher (best practices, code style) and test-runner (task-specific tests)
  - `plan-product.md` - Uses file-creator (directory creation) and context-fetcher (tech stack defaults)
  - `create-spec.md` - Uses file-creator (spec folder) and context-fetcher (mission/roadmap checks)
- **Standards Files** - Updated for conditional agent usage:
  - `code-style.md` - Uses context-fetcher for loading language-specific style guides
- **Setup Scripts** - Enhanced to install Claude Code agents:
  - `setup-claude-code.sh` - Downloads all agents to `~/.claude/agents/` directory

### Improved
- **Context Efficiency** - Specialized agents use minimal context for their specific tasks
- **Code Organization** - Complex operations delegated to focused agents with clear responsibilities
- **Error Handling** - Agents provide targeted error analysis and recovery strategies
- **Maintainability** - Cleaner main agent code with operations abstracted to subagents
- **Performance** - Reduced context checks through one-time agent detection pattern

### Technical Details
- Each agent uses only necessary tools (e.g., test-runner uses only Bash, Read, Grep, Glob)
- Automatic fallback ensures compatibility for users without Claude Code
- Consistent `IF has_[agent_name]:` pattern reduces code complexity
- All agents follow Agent OS conventions (branch naming, commit messages, file templates)

  - `standards/code-style/html-style.md` for HTML markup
  - `standards/code-style/javascript-style.md` for JavaScript
- Conditional loading blocks in `best-practices.md` and `code-style.md` to prevent duplicate context loading

- Reduced duplication when files are referenced multiple times in a workflow
- Clearer separation between task-specific and full test suite execution
- More intelligent file loading that checks current context before reading
